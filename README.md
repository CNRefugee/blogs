# blogs
this is my blog project
### how to start
1. write post in posts with 'metadata' above
 you can replace the tag with your own
e.g. 
```markdown
---
title: "Test Post"
date: 2024-07-25
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

# Test Post

This is a test post.
```
2. run the script to generate tag.md
```shell
python generate_tags.py
```
